When you have software problems A and B, the complexity of solving A and B at
the same time is C(A) * C(B), but if you solve them separately then the
complexity is C(A) + C(B). Always split your problems into the smallest units
possible, it will make your life an order of magnitud less difficult.

The hero of the Odyssey is a great fighter, a wily schemer, a ready speaker, a
man of stout heart and broad wisdom who knows that he must endure without too much
complaining what the gods send; and he can both build and sail a boat, drive a
furrow as straight as anyone, beat a young braggart at throwing the discus,
challenge the Pheacian youth at boxing, wrestling or running; flay, skin, cut up
and cook an ox, and be moved to tears by a song. He is in fact an excellent
all-rounder; he has surpassing aretê.

Aretê implies a respect for the wholeness or oneness of life, and a consequent
dislike of specialization. It implies a contempt for efficiency—or rather a much
higher idea of efficiency, an efficiency which exists not in one department of
life but in life itself.
